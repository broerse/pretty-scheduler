# Pretty-scheduler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ksin/pretty-scheduler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ksin/pretty-scheduler)

[Pretty Scheduler](http://www.prettyscheduler.com/) - a scheduler app for finding common availabilities among your friends. Create an event and share it with your friends to see what dates work best for everyone!

To see an example event, visit: [/events/23](http://www.prettyscheduler.com/events/23)

This is still very much a WIP. The client-side server is backed by ember-cli-mirage, so none of your data will be persisted after you leave. Unfortunately, that also means this app isn't very useful yet.
